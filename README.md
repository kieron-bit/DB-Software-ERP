## Quickstart

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
-- See docs/database-schema.sql for the complete schema
```

## Operational Notes

To ensure multi-tenant security and session context, always set:

```sql
SET LOCAL app.current_company_id = '<company-UUID>';
SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = '<user-UUID>';
```
