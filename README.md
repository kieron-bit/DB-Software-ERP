DB-Software-ERP-Construction
PWA Multi-Tenant Database

This project started as a personal challenge: learning how to code by building an ERP system tailored for construction SMEs.

The goal is to design a solution that is:

Simple and intuitive for everyday use,

Accessible across platforms:

Mobile (PWA) for workers on construction sites,

Desktop / Backoffice for project and company managers,

Scalable and secure, with strong foundations for multi-company usage.

I began by sketching the user experience on paper, focusing on seamless workflows. Once the main components were clear, I designed the database schema as the backbone of the system.

🔑 Main Features So Far

Multi-company support (separation of data per company).

User management with roles (admin, supervisor, worker) and activation codes.

Audit and traceability (activity logs, change tracking).

Workforce management (projects, work hours, correction requests).

Finance management (invoices, balances, payments).

Export and reporting (data history, file generation).

📌 Project Status

This project is ongoing. As I continue learning and experimenting with new features, I regularly expand the schema and refine its design.

It already provides a solid foundation for an ERP system, but it also serves as a learning lab — helping me explore how real-world business logic can be translated into structured, scalable software.
